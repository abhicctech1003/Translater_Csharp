# Translater_Csharp

This repository contains code for two assignments related to reading and converting 3D geometry files:

1. **STL to OBJ Converter**: This code converts STL files into OBJ format and stores the output into an OBJ file.

2. **OBJ to STL Converter**: Here, the code converts OBJ files into STL format and saves the output into an STL file.

## Instructions for Usage

### STL to OBJ Converter
1. Open the `stltoobj.sln` solution file.
2. Specify the path to the STL file you want to convert.
3. Run the project to execute the conversion process.
4. The resulting OBJ file will be saved in the specified location.

### OBJ to STL Converter
1. Open the `ObjToStl.sln` solution file.
2. Input the path to the OBJ file you want to convert to STL.
3. Build and run the project to start the conversion process.
4. The converted STL file will be generated and saved in the output directory.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to provide the correct file paths and ensure that the input files are in the appropriate format for successful conversion.
- Check the console output for any error messages or status updates during the conversion process.
