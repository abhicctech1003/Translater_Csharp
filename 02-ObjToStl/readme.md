# OBJ to STL Converter

This utility facilitates the conversion of OBJ files to STL format, offering compatibility and flexibility in 3D modeling workflows.

## Overview

While OBJ files are versatile and widely used for storing 3D model data, STL files are commonly used for 3D printing and rapid prototyping. This converter streamlines the conversion process, enabling users to seamlessly transition between these formats. By converting OBJ files to STL, users can leverage the benefits of STL format for 3D printing and additive manufacturing applications.

## Key Features

- **Effortless Conversion**: Convert OBJ files to STL format with ease.
- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with 3D printers and slicing software that support STL format.
- **Geometry Preservation**: Retain the geometric integrity and topology of the original OBJ model during conversion.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for straightforward file selection and conversion.

## Usage

1. **Select OBJ File**: Choose the OBJ file you wish to convert to STL.
2. **Initiate Conversion**: Start the conversion process with a single click.
3. **Save Output**: The resulting STL file will be saved in the same directory as the original OBJ file.

## Technical Details

- **Development Environment**: Developed using C# in Visual Studio.
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes efficient algorithms to process vertex coordinates and triangle data from OBJ files.
- **Triangulation**: Performs triangulation to prepare the data for STL format conversion.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms ensure smooth execution and user feedback.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Software**: .NET Framework or .NET Core
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of 3D file formats and C# programming language.

## Additional Information

- The converter supports batch conversion of multiple OBJ files to STL format.
- Users can customize conversion settings, such as mesh resolution and output file naming conventions.
- Regular updates are provided to enhance performance, compatibility, and feature set.
