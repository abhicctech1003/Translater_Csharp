# STL to OBJ Converter

This application converts STL files to OBJ format, facilitating easy conversion and compatibility between different 3D modeling software.

## Overview

STL files are commonly used for 3D printing and modeling, but they lack certain features like color and texture information. OBJ files, on the other hand, support more complex geometry and material properties, making them suitable for a wider range of applications. This converter bridges the gap between these formats by converting STL files to OBJ format.

## Features

- **Simple Conversion**: Convert STL files to OBJ format with just a few clicks.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility between different 3D modeling software that support OBJ format.
- **Preservation of Geometry**: Retain the geometry and topology of the original model during conversion.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for easy navigation and file selection.

## Usage

1. **Input STL File**: Select the STL file you want to convert.
2. **Conversion Process**: Click the "Convert" button to initiate the conversion process.
3. **Output OBJ File**: Once the conversion is complete, the resulting OBJ file will be saved in the same directory as the original STL file.

## Implementation Details

- **Language and Environment**: Developed in C# using Visual Studio.
- **Parsing Algorithm**: Utilizes efficient parsing algorithms to extract vertex coordinates and triangle data from the STL file.
- **Format Conversion**: Converts the extracted data into OBJ format, preserving geometry and topology.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth execution and user feedback.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Software**: .NET Framework or .NET Core
- **Knowledge**: Basic understanding of 3D file formats and C# programming language.

## Additional Information

- The application provides options for customizing output settings, such as specifying the output directory and file name.
- Users can review conversion logs for detailed information about the conversion process.
- Regular updates and improvements are implemented to enhance performance and functionality.
